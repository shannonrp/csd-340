                <p>We collect Funko Pop! figures and have amassed over 250 in our collection.  We share some, but then we each have our own.  Some of the genres we share 
                    are Marvel characters, Chicago sports figures, anime, The Office, and some random TV shows or movies.  My husband is 
                    a horror fan and has a large collection of pop figures og his own, while my collection contains Seinfeld, Parks and Rec, and Peanuts.  This picture 
                    is just small part of our entire collection.  Below is a picture of some of our shared Pops!

                <p>This is a photo of my husband, Chuck, and I after hiking South Mountain in Phoenix.  One thing I love to do is workout.  I workout six days
                    a week, every morning before work and on Sundays.  I like to run, walk, bike, spin classes, weight train, pilates, and yoga to name a few.
                    It helps me to clear my mind and get ready for my day as it is my quiet time.  
                </p>
                <p>I also enjoy playing video games.  Right now Mario Kart and Animal Crossing: New Horizon are what I spend my time playing.  I also enjoy
                    watching content creators on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="blank">Twitch</a> play video games.  I watch various games and creators.  
                    It usually depends on my mood what game I watch.
                </p>
                <p>I also enjoy reading and playing with my dogs.  Rossy is going to be eleven this year and Parker will be three.  They can be quite the handful, but so much fun.</p>
                <p>One of my interests is astronomy.  That was my favorite class the first time I was in college and I love being up and going for a run at
                    4 a.m.  I get to see all the starts and watch the constellations move across the sky throughout the year.  I also get to see the different phases of the moon
                    and watch the planets as they come into view.
